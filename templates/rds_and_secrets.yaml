Description:  Template builds a private webserver instance, a bastion host, a database, an application load balancer, and an autoscaling group for the webserver.  A simple index.html file is downloaded from an S3 bucket into the webserver upon webserver creation. The template also builds a Secrets Manager, and uses a Lambda function in a pre-built S3 bucket to enable rotation of the secret.
